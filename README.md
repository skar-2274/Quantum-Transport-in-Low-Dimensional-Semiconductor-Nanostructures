Simulation of material conductance values with varying parameters

Simulation Capabilities:
 Applying various parameters to visualise different behaviours.
 Displaying integer plateaus, half-integer plateaus and quarter-integer plateaus.
 Plotting multiple traces in the same graph by offsetting results.
 Comparing different variables such as source-drain voltage and magnetic field.
 The adjustable parameters are included in the filenames.
